						<h3> Press Kit Design </h3>
						<p> The press kit serves as an essential touchpoint in developing a fundamental understanding of what the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation strives to accomplish, and a call to action to get involved.</p>
						<p>The design concept was driven by the need to create a press kit that would position itself as a valued envoy from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. An essential part of the design process involved strategically elevating how the press kit is perceived, interacted with, and experienced. Engaging the viewer's tactile sense of touch and tangible reality, would elicit the viewer's innate instinct and drive to form a meaningful connection, engaging its viewer in his/her entirety.</p>
