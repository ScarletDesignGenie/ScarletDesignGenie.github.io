			<p>Becoming a graphic designer started as an act of deep curiosity and passion, 
				<br> which has continued to blossom into a lifelong affair marked by 
				<br>fascination and insatiable determination. 

				<br>All of which have led me to nderstand the immense power of communicative medium 
				<br> as a whole, and developing a keen awareness of how profoundly influenced we 
				<br>are by our visual landscape, how vastly humans truly are visual beings, and 
				<br>how quickly our minds are triggered to respond to visual stimuli as forces that 
				<br>influence the way we engage with the world around us. 

				<br>As Scarlet DesignGenie, I strive to provide exceptional visual communications 
				<br>solutions and strategies that translate into opportunities and results in the 
				<br>growth and development of your business
